To run the program in xcode: 

1. npm install in directory
2. Make React a target dependency in the XCode Project. 
3. For MaterialFonts error, run 'react-native link react-native-vector-icons'

An alternative to step 2, possibly, is to run 
'
cd node_modules/react-native/scripts && ./ios-install-third-party.sh && cd ../../../
$ cd node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog-0.3.5/ && ../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh 
&& cd ../../../../*
'
